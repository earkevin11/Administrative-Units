# Administrative-Units

# What is the purpose of administrative units?
- IT admins will use administrative units to isolate managing access. 
- For example, IT admins will create several administrative units for each department. 
- An administrator(s) will be assigned to manage one of the several administrative units

# In the below diagram:
- Administrative A contains a subset of users and will be managed by <em> only </em> Admin A
- Administrative B contains a subset of users and will be managed by <em> only </em> Admin B
- Administrative C contains a subset of users and will be managed by <em> only </em> Admin C
